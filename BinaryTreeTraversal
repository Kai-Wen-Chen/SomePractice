Given a binary tree, return the values of its nodes in bottom-up level order.

ex:
      1
     / \
    2   3
   / \ / \
  4  5 6  7
  
The answer will be {(6, 7), (4, 5), (2, 3), (1)}

One approach is to reverse the regular traversal.

Reversal:
Put the current value in a set, then put the value of its left node and right node in another set.

In the end, put all sets in another set, reverse the order of them
