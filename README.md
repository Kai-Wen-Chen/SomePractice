# SomePractice
Here is some of my programming practice

TwoNumbers:

Given some integers (negative ones are permitted) which are placed in a vector.

Then a target number is given. We should find two numbers that the sum of them is equal to the target

among the input. The answer should be the places of them in the vector and we assume that there's only

a pair of them could result in the answer. Ex: [1, 2, 3, 4], 6 => [1, 3]
