# SomePractice
Here is some of my programming practice

\n

TwoNumbers:

Given some integers (negative ones are permitted) which are placed in a vector.

Then a target number is given. We should find two numbers that the sum of them is equal to the target

among the input. The answer should be the places of them in the vector and we assume that there's only

a pair of them could result in the answer. Ex: [1, 2, 3, 4], 6 => [1, 3]

\n

ReverseInteger:

Given a 32-bit integer, then print the reverse of it. If overflow, print 0 instead.

\n

BinartCarryBits:

Given a decimal number N, find the number of carry bits needed when N+1 in binary format.

ex:

N = 1 => N = 01, N+1 = 10 => #carry bits = 1

N = 7 => N = 0111, N+1 = 1000 => #carry bits = 3

N = 4 => N = 100, N+1 = 101 => #carrt bits = 0
