To determine if a linked list contains a cycle, take two pointers to deal with it.

A pointer moves to next pointer each time while the other pointer moves next two pointers.

Based on the GCD, if the linked list contains a cycle, the two pointers will be same at some point.

code:

if (head == null) return false;

ptr1 = ptr2 = head;

while (ptr1->next && ptr2->next->next){
  ptr1 = ptr1->next;
  ptr2 = ptr2->next->next;
  if (ptr1 == ptr2) return true;
}

return false;
